The Forge is a cross-platform rendering framework supporting
- PC 
  * Windows 10 
     * with DirectX 12 / Vulkan 1.1
     * with DirectX Ray Tracing API
     * DirectX 11 Fallback Layer for Windows 7 support (not extensively tested)
  * Linux Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Vulkan 1.1
- Android Pie with Vulkan 1.1
- macOS with Metal 2
- iOS with Metal 2
- XBOX One / XBOX One X (only available for accredited developers on request)
- PS4 (in development) (only available for accredited developers on request)

Particularly, the graphics layer of The Forge supports cross-platform
- Descriptor management
- Multi-threaded resource loading
- Shader reflection
- Multi-threaded command buffer generation

The Forge can be used to provide the rendering layer for custom next-gen game engines. It is also meant to provide building blocks to write your own game engine. It is like a "lego" set that allows you to use pieces to build a game engine quickly. The "lego" High-Level Features supported on all platforms are at the moment:
- [Lua Scripting System](https://www.lua.org/) - currently used in 06_Playground to load models and textures and animate the camera
- Animation System based on [Ozz Animation System](https://github.com/guillaumeblanc/ozz-animation)
- Consistent Math Library  based on an extended version of [Vectormath](https://github.com/glampert/vectormath)
- Extended version of [TinySTL](https://github.com/mendsley/tinystl)
- For loading art assets we have a modified and integrated version of [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)
- Consistent Memory Managament: on GPU following [Vulkan Memory Allocator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)
- Input system with Gestures for Touch devices based on an extended version of [gainput](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/gainput)
- Very fast Entity Component System based on [ENTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt)
- UI system based on [imGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) with a dedicated unit test extended for touch input devices
- [Micro Profiler](https://github.com/zeux/microprofile)
- Various implementations of high-end Graphics Effects as shown in the unit tests below

Please find a link and credits for all open-source packages used at the end of this readme.


Future plans are
- Unified shader generation -> check out an alpha version of the [Confetti Shader Translator](http://confettishadertranslator.azurewebsites.net). This shader translator is build with the purpose of supporting a higher-level shading language, which we call super HLSL or short sHLSL

# News

## Release 1.23 - February 14th, 2019 - New Cross-Platform Ray Tracing Interface 
Happy Valentines! Here is some love from The Forge team:
- new cross-platform Ray Tracing interface in IRay.h, currently supporting DXR (Vulkan comes next) and Metal Ray Tracing on Windows, macOS and iOS. In other words you can now write Ray Tracing code that runs on Windows, macOS and iOS. You will need a RTX GPU to run this on Windows. On macOS / iOS only latest software update is needed.

PC Windows 10 RS5, DirectX12, GeForce RTX 2070, Driver version 418.81 with resolution 3440x1440:

    - iOS 12.2 beta (16E5181f)
    - Xcode 10.2 beta (10P82s)
  - a few months ago, we submitted a bug report for wave intrinsics to Apple and with the latest firmware beta (see above), wave intrinsics are working now in unit test 15
  - support PVR texture compression (V3 header) on iOS 

- Improvements for all Platforms:
  - 3D Texture mip maps for write
  - Unified texture subresource updates across all APIs
  - Memory optimizations: much less memory is used across all platforms
- All the unit tests are now in one folder unit test and they are in one solution file


## Release 1.22 - January 22nd, 2019 - TressFX Hair | Entity Component System | Lua Scripting System
This is the first release in 2019 and The Forge GitHub repository is today exactly one year old, with the first release on the same day last year :-) In 2018 we made 22 releases and we improved The Forge in many areas.
If you followed us so far ... why not just join us? We are looking for more graphics programmers joining our teams. We have offices in Encinitas, CA USA (Main) / Mumbai, India / Shanghai, China / Breda, Netherlands / St. Petersburg, Russia and in Lviv, Ukraine.

Now back to release notes: many years ago in 2012 / 2013, we helped AMD and Crystal Dynamics with the development of TressFX for [Tomb Raider](https://gfxspeak.com/2013/05/21/amd-and-confetti-collaborate-on-hair/). We also wrote an article about the implementation in [GPU Pro 5](http://gpupro.blogspot.com/2013/10/gpu-pro-5-table-of-contents.html ) and gave a few joint presentations on conferences like [FMX](https://www.slideshare.net/WolfgangEngel/hair-intombraider-final). At the end of last year we revisited TressFX. We took the current code in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/TressFX), changed it a bit and ported it to The Forge. It now runs on PC with DirectX 12 / Vulkan, Linux with Vulkan, macOS and iOS with Metal 2 and on the XBOX One. We also created a few new hair assets so that we can showcase it. Here are screenshots of our programmers art:

PC Windows DirectX 12 GTX 950 Driver 416.81:

![Hair on PC](Screenshots/MaterialPlayground/06_MaterialPlayground_Hair_closup.gif)

iPad (Model A1803):

![Hair on iOS](Screenshots/MaterialPlayground/06_MaterialPlayground_hair_iOS_ponytail.png)


The current implementation is overall too slow to be used on some of our platforms but we are going to improve performance over time. We are also going to improve the hair art assets.
Apart from Hair, the Material Playground now also has improved versions of Metal and a new material category Wood:

Metal:

![Material Playground Metal on PC](Screenshots/MaterialPlayground/06_MaterialPlayground_Metal.png)

Wood:

![Material Playground Wood on PC](Screenshots/MaterialPlayground/06_MaterialPlayground_Wood.png)

- New Entity component system (ECS) for all platforms: we've chosen to integrate ENTT (https://github.com/skypjack/entt) into The Forge. The initial implementation was contributed by Amer Koleci @AmerKoleci:

![Image of the Entity Component System unit test in The Forge](Screenshots/17_EntityComponentSystem.png)

- Lua Scripting System for all platforms: the Lua scripting integration allows to register functions to lua contexts so these functions will be available via scripts. Functions can be static or lambda. In latter case you can store some state information within lambda. Scripts are executed using LuaManager::RunScript() or LuaManager::AddAsyncScript() methods. In second case scripts are still executed in synchronous way. Async execution implementation is planned. Also there is "updateable" script. It is loaded (at this point script main body is executed), then it can be "updated" - update() function from script is invoked. Script can invoke any registered function and can store state information which will be available from update to update. The script can be reloaded - can be useful for fast iterations when you just modify script and don't even need to restart application. If that script contains exit() function then it will be executed when script is reloaded or closed. Checkout unit test 06_MaterialPlayground for an example on how to use it. In this unit tests it executes three scripts to load models and textures and animate the camera.



## Release 1.21 - December 1st, 2018 - Season Greetings with new Skinning Unit Test | Unified Vulkan Shaders
The team will soon go into winter hybernation mode ... which means many Confetti people will fly home over the holiday season to spend time with their loved ones. We will be back with more releases next year, probably in February. 

To send you season greetings, we extended our Ozz implementation by adding a new Skinning unit test:

# PC Windows Requirements:

1. Windows 10 RS5 with latest update for DXR support


2. Drivers
* AMD / NVIDIA - latest drivers 
* Intel - need to install the latest driver (currently Version: 25.20.100.6326, October 9th, 2018) [Intel® Graphics Driver for Windows® 10](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/28240/Intel-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-10?product=80939). As mentioned before this driver still doesn't have full DirectX 12 and Vulkan support.


3. Visual Studio 2017 with Windows SDK / DirectX version 17763.132 
https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive

4. Vulkan [1.1.92.1](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)


5. Ray Tracing 
 * DirectX Raytracing Experimental SDK v0.09.01
 * Windows 10 RS4 builds more info at [DXR](http://aka.ms/DXR)

6. The Forge is currently tested on 
* AMD 5x, VEGA GPUs (various)
* NVIDIA GeForce 9x, 10x GPUs (various)
* Intel Skull Canyon


# macOS Requirements:

1. macOS Mojave 10.14.4 beta (18E174f)

2. Xcode 10.2 beta (10P82s)

3. The Forge is currently tested on the following macOS devices:
* iMac with AMD RADEON 560 (Part No. MNDY2xx/A)
* iMac with AMD RADEON 580 (Part No. MNED2xx/A)
* MacBook Pro 13 inch (MacBookPro13,2) 
* Macbook Pro 13 inch (MacbookPro14,2)

In the moment we do not have access to an iMac Pro or Mac Pro. We can test those either with Team Viewer access or by getting them into the office and integrating them into our build system.
We will not test any Hackintosh configuration. 


# iOS Requirements:

1. iOS 12.2 beta (16E5181f)

2. XCode: see macOS

To run the unit tests, The Forge requires an iOS device with an A9 or higher CPU (see [GPU Processors](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeviceInformation/Reference/iOSDeviceCompatibility/HardwareGPUInformation/HardwareGPUInformation.html) or see iOS_Family in this table [iOS_GPUFamily3_v3](https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Feature-Set-Tables.pdf)). This is required to support the hardware tessellation unit test and the ExecuteIndirect unit test (requires indirect buffer support). The Visibility Buffer doesn't run on current iOS devices because the [texture argument buffer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/fundamental_components/gpu_resources/understanding_argument_buffers) on those devices is limited to 31 (see [Metal Feature Set Table](https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Feature-Set-Tables.pdf) and look for the entry "Maximum number of entries in the texture argument table, per graphics or compute function") , while on macOS it is 128, which we need for the bindless texture array.

  chmod +x PRE_BUILD.command
  
    It will only download and unzip required Art Assets (No plugins/extensions install). 

# Unit Tests
There are the following unit tests in The Forge:

## 1. Transformation

This unit test just shows a simple solar system. It is our "3D game Hello World" setup for cross-platform rendering.

![Image of the Transformations Unit test](Screenshots/01_Transformations.PNG)

## 2. Compute

This unit test shows a Julia 4D fractal running in a compute shader. In the future this test will use several compute queues at once.

![Image of the Compute Shader Unit test](Screenshots/02_Compute.PNG)

## 3. Multi-Threaded Rendering

This unit test shows how to generate a large number of command buffers on all platforms supported by The Forge. This unit test is based on [a demo by Intel called Stardust](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-vulkan-graphics-api-to-render-a-cloud-of-animated-particles-in-stardust-application).

![Image of the Multi-Threaded command buffer generation example](Screenshots/03_MultiThreading.PNG)

## 9a. Hybrid Ray-Traced Shadows
This unit test was build by Kostas Anagnostou @KostasAAA to show how to ray trace shadows without using a ray tracing API like DXR / RTX. It should run on all GPUs (not just NVIDIA RTX GPUs) and the expectation is that it should run comparable with a DXR / RTX based version even on a NVIDIA RTX GPU. That means the users of your game do not have to buy a NVIDIA RTX GPU to enjoy HRT shadows :-)
![Hybrid Ray Traced Shadows](Screenshots/09a_HRT_Shadows.png)


## 10. Pixel-Projected Reflections
This unit test shows reflections that are ray traced. It is an implementation of the papers [Optimized pixel-projected reflections for planar reflectors](http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2017/PixelProjectedReflectionsAC_v_1.92.pdf) and [IMPLEMENTATION OF OPTIMIZED PIXEL-PROJECTED REFLECTIONS FOR PLANAR REFLECTORS](https://github.com/byumjin/Jin-Engine-2.1/blob/master/%5BByumjin%20Kim%5D%20Master%20Thesis_Final.pdf)
