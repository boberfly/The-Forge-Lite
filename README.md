The-Forge-Lite is a stripped-down version of The-Forge which just supplies the renderer interface, uses CMake to build and contains the bare minimum of third-party libraries.

The public interfaces also try to reduce the amount of headers needed, but TinySTL is still needed.

The idea is also to keep these changes to a minimum so that it is easy and straightforward to update from ConfettiFX's [GitHub](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge).

If you are new to The-Forge, I highly recommend using the official one and not this one, it is fairly specific to my needs. However it might be useful to you if you just wanted the excellent graphics API abstraction and straightforward build process.

From the official The-Forge readme:

# ![The Forge Logo](Screenshots/TheForge-on-white.jpg)

The Forge is a cross-platform rendering framework supporting
- PC 
  * Windows 10 
     * with DirectX 12 / Vulkan 1.1
     * with DirectX Ray Tracing API
     * DirectX 11 Fallback Layer for Windows 7 support (not extensively tested)
  * Linux Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Vulkan 1.1
- Android Pie with Vulkan 1.1
- macOS with Metal 2
- iOS with Metal 2
- XBOX One / XBOX One X (only available for accredited developers on request)
- PS4 (only available for accredited developers on request)

Particularly, the graphics layer of The Forge supports cross-platform
- Descriptor management
- Multi-threaded and asynchronous resource loading
- Shader reflection
- Multi-threaded command buffer generation

The Forge can be used to provide the rendering layer for custom next-gen game engines. It is also meant to provide building blocks to write your own game engine. It is like a "lego" set that allows you to use pieces to build a game engine quickly. The "lego" High-Level Features supported on all platforms are at the moment:
- Asynchronous Resource loading with a resource loader task system as shown in 10_PixelProjectedReflections
- [Lua Scripting System](https://www.lua.org/) - currently used in 06_Playground to load models and textures and animate the camera
- Animation System based on [Ozz Animation System](https://github.com/guillaumeblanc/ozz-animation)
- Consistent Math Library  based on an extended version of [Vectormath](https://github.com/glampert/vectormath)
- Extended version of [EASTL](https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL/)
- For loading art assets we have a modified and integrated version of [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)
- Consistent Memory Managament: on GPU following [Vulkan Memory Allocator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)
- Input system with Gestures for Touch devices based on an extended version of [gainput](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/gainput)
- Very fast Entity Component System based on [ENTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt)
- UI system based on [imGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) with a dedicated unit test extended for touch input devices
- Various implementations of high-end Graphics Effects as shown in the unit tests below

# News


## Release 1.29 - June 6th, 2019 - EASTL Integration | Micro-profiler improvements | Neon intrinsic Support
 * We replaced for all platforms TinySTL with [EASTL](https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL/) for support of additional data structures and functionality. This was a major change and we still expect a few bugs to appear.
 * ARM based platforms (iOS/Android) can pick a new NEON intrinsics code path in our math library
 * Microprofiler  
   * Multithreaded GPU Profiling is now supported
   * Microprofiler is now enabled on all the Unit-tests and togglable using UI checkbox.
   * Added new common interface, IProfiler.h
 * Issue list: 
   * #105 - 04_ExecuteIndirect crash on macOS


## Release 1.28 - May 24th, 2019 - SWB Level Editor | Micro Profiler Re-Write | Log and File System improvements | better macOS/iOS support 
We added a new section below the Examples to show screenshots and an explanation of some of the Tools that we integrated. We will fill this up over the next few releases.
* We were helping James Webb with his level editor for 'Star Wars Galaxies' called SWB that now uses The Forge

Here is a screenshot

![SWB Level Editor](Screenshots/SWB.png)

SWB is an editor for the 2003 game 'Star Wars Galaxies' that can edit terrains, scenes, particles and import/export models via FBX. The editor uses an engine called 'atlas' that will be made open source in the future. It focuses on making efficient use of the new graphics APIs (with help from The-Forge!), ease-of-use and terrain rendering.
* Memory tracking: 
  * Fluid memory tracker cross-platform for Windows, macOS and Linux
  * We used MTuner to remove many memory leaks and improve memory usage. MTuner might be integrated in the future.
* [Micro Profiler](https://github.com/zeux/microprofile): our initial implementation of Microprofiler needed to be re-done from scratch. This time we wanted to do the integration right and also implemented the dedicated UI. 

![Microprofiler in Visibility Buffer](Screenshots/MicroProfileExampleVisibilityBuffer.png)

![Microprofiler in Visibility Buffer](Screenshots/MicroProfileExampleVisibilityBuffer2.png)

To enable/disable profiling, go to file ProfileEnableMacro.h line 9 and set it
to 0(disabled) or 1(enabled). 
It's supported on the following platforms:
 - Windows
 - Linux
 - macOS (GPU profiling is disabled)
 - iOS (GPU profiling is disabled)
 - Android(WIP will be enabled later on)

We can find MicroProfile integrated in the follwing examples (more will follow):
 - Unit Test 02_Compute
 - VisibilityBuffer

How to use it:
MicroProfile has different display modes. The most useful one when running inside
the application is Timers. We can change the display mode going to Mode and right
clicking the one we want.

If we are on Timer, we will be able to right click on the labels. This will enable
a graph at the bottom left.

If we wanted to just see some of the groups inside the profile display, go to Groups
and select the ones you want.

The other options are self explanatory.

If the user wants to dump the profile to a file, we just need to go to dump,
and right click on the amount of frames we want. This generates a html file in the
executable folder. Open it with your prefered web browser to have a look.

Dumping is useful, because we will be able to see the profile frame by frame,
without it being updated every frame. This will be useful when displaying in Detailed
mode.

There is also a Help menu item.
* Log system improvements: 
  * Support for multiple log files
  * Easy to use log macros
  * Scoped logging
  * Multithreaded support
  * New log format: date, time, thread, file, line, log level and message
  * No need to declare global LogManager, it will be created on demand
* Filesystem improvements: this is fed  back from one of our game engine integrations of The Forge
  * file time functions now use time_t
  * added FileWatcher class for Windows/Linux/macOS
  * added CombinePaths function
* macOS / iOS Metal: 
  * added Barriers with memoryBarrierWithScope for Buffers,Textures and Render targets
  * added GPU sync with MTLFence as fallback (for cross encoder synchranization and BlitEncoder where memoryBarrier isn't available). Removed force fence on render targets change because it is no longer necessary. There might be a small performance improvements coming from this
  * support of Microprofiler see above
  * refactor of windows support code: replaced MTKView for iOS and macOS with a custom NSview and NSWindow implementation. We have more explicit control now over the window.
* Issues fixed:
  * #112 - cmdBindDescriptors performance issue (DX12)
  * #110 - RenderDoc compatibility with SM6+

See the release notes from previous releases in the [Release section](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge/releases).

  
# PC Windows Requirements:

1. Windows 10 


2. Drivers
* AMD / NVIDIA - latest drivers 
* Intel - need to install the latest driver (currently Version: 25.20.100.6326, October 9th, 2018) [Intel® Graphics Driver for Windows® 10](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/28240/Intel-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-10?product=80939). As mentioned before this driver still doesn't have full DirectX 12 and Vulkan support.


3. Visual Studio 2017 with Windows SDK / DirectX version 17763.132 (you need to get it via the Visual Studio Intaller)
https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive

4. Vulkan [1.1.101.0](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)

6. The Forge is currently tested on 
* AMD 5x, VEGA GPUs (various)
* NVIDIA GeForce 9x, 10x. 20x GPUs (various)
* Intel Skull Canyon


# macOS Requirements:

1. macOS Mojave 10.14.4 beta (18E174f)

2. Xcode 10.2 beta (10P82s)

3. The Forge is currently tested on the following macOS devices:
* iMac with AMD RADEON 560 (Part No. MNDY2xx/A)
* iMac with AMD RADEON 580 (Part No. MNED2xx/A)
* MacBook Pro 13 inch (MacBookPro13,2) 
* Macbook Pro 13 inch (MacbookPro14,2)

In the moment we do not have access to an iMac Pro or Mac Pro. We can test those either with Team Viewer access or by getting them into the office and integrating them into our build system.
We will not test any Hackintosh configuration. 


# iOS Requirements:

1. iOS 12.2 beta (16E5181f)

2. XCode: see macOS

To run the unit tests, The Forge requires an iOS device with an A9 or higher CPU (see [GPU Processors](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeviceInformation/Reference/iOSDeviceCompatibility/HardwareGPUInformation/HardwareGPUInformation.html) or see iOS_Family in this table [iOS_GPUFamily3_v3](https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Feature-Set-Tables.pdf)). This is required to support the hardware tessellation unit test and the ExecuteIndirect unit test (requires indirect buffer support). The Visibility Buffer doesn't run on current iOS devices because the [texture argument buffer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/fundamental_components/gpu_resources/understanding_argument_buffers) on those devices is limited to 31 (see [Metal Feature Set Table](https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Feature-Set-Tables.pdf) and look for the entry "Maximum number of entries in the texture argument table, per graphics or compute function") , while on macOS it is 128, which we need for the bindless texture array. 

We are currently testing on 
* iPhone 7 (Model A1778)

  chmod +x PRE_BUILD.command
  
    It will only download and unzip required Art Assets (No plugins/extensions install). 

# Unit Tests
There are the following unit tests in The Forge:

## 1. Transformation

This unit test just shows a simple solar system. It is our "3D game Hello World" setup for cross-platform rendering.

![Image of the Transformations Unit test](Screenshots/01_Transformations.PNG)

## 2. Compute

This unit test shows a Julia 4D fractal running in a compute shader. In the future this test will use several compute queues at once.

![Image of the Compute Shader Unit test](Screenshots/02_Compute.PNG)

## 3. Multi-Threaded Rendering

This unit test shows how to generate a large number of command buffers on all platforms supported by The Forge. This unit test is based on [a demo by Intel called Stardust](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-vulkan-graphics-api-to-render-a-cloud-of-animated-particles-in-stardust-application).

![Image of the Multi-Threaded command buffer generation example](Screenshots/03_MultiThreading.PNG)

## 9a. Hybrid Ray-Traced Shadows
This unit test was build by Kostas Anagnostou @KostasAAA to show how to ray trace shadows without using a ray tracing API like DXR / RTX. It should run on all GPUs (not just NVIDIA RTX GPUs) and the expectation is that it should run comparable with a DXR / RTX based version even on a NVIDIA RTX GPU. That means the users of your game do not have to buy a NVIDIA RTX GPU to enjoy HRT shadows :-)
![Hybrid Ray Traced Shadows](Screenshots/09a_HRT_Shadows.png)


## 10. Pixel-Projected Reflections
This unit test shows reflections that are ray traced. It is an implementation of the papers [Optimized pixel-projected reflections for planar reflectors](http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2017/PixelProjectedReflectionsAC_v_1.92.pdf) and [IMPLEMENTATION OF OPTIMIZED PIXEL-PROJECTED REFLECTIONS FOR PLANAR REFLECTORS](https://github.com/byumjin/Jin-Engine-2.1/blob/master/%5BByumjin%20Kim%5D%20Master%20Thesis_Final.pdf)

# Examples
There is an example implementation of the Triangle Visibility Buffer as covered in various conference talks. [Here](https://diaryofagraphicsprogrammer.blogspot.com/2018/03/triangle-visibility-buffer.html) is a blog entry that details the implementation in The Forge.

![Image of the Visibility Buffer](Screenshots/Visibility_Buffer.png)


# Tools
Below are screenshots and descriptions of some of the tools we integrated.

## Microprofiler
We integrated the [Micro Profiler](https://github.com/zeux/microprofile) into our code base. 

![Microprofiler in Visibility Buffer](Screenshots/MicroProfileExampleVisibilityBuffer.png)

![Microprofiler in Visibility Buffer](Screenshots/MicroProfileExampleVisibilityBuffer2.png)

To enable/disable profiling, go to file ProfileEnableMacro.h line 9 and set it
to 0(disabled) or 1(enabled). 
It's supported on the following platforms:
 - Windows
 - Linux
 - macOS (GPU profiling is disabled)
 - iOS (GPU profiling is disabled)
 - Android(WIP will be enabled later on)

We can find MicroProfile integrated in the follwing examples:
 - Unit Test 02_Compute
 - VisibilityBuffer

MicroProfile provides us an easy to use UI and visualization our frame.

How to use it:
MicroProfile has different display modes. The most useful one when running inside
the application is Timers. We can change the display mode going to Mode and right
clicking the one we want.

If we are on Timer, we will be able to right click on the labels. This will enable
a graph at the bottom left.

If we wanted to just see some of the groups inside the profile display, go to Groups
and select the ones you want.

The other options are self explanatory.

If the user wants to dump the profile to a file, we just need to go to dump,
and right click on the amount of frames we want. This generates a html file in the
executable folder. Open it with your prefered web browser to have a look.

Dumping is useful, because we will be able to see the profile frame by frame,
without it being updated every frame. This will be useful when displaying in Detailed
mode.
