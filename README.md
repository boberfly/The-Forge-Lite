The-Forge-Lite is a stripped-down version of The-Forge which just supplies the renderer interface, uses CMake to build and contains the bare minimum of third-party libraries.

The public interfaces also try to reduce the amount of headers needed, but TinySTL is still needed.

The idea is also to keep these changes to a minimum so that it is easy and straightforward to update from ConfettiFX's [GitHub](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge).

If you are new to The-Forge, I highly recommend using the official one and not this one, it is fairly specific to my needs. However it might be useful to you if you just wanted the excellent graphics API abstraction and straightforward build process.

From the official The-Forge readme:

# ![The Forge Logo](Screenshots/TheForge-on-white.jpg)

The Forge is a cross-platform rendering framework supporting
- PC 
  * Windows 10 
     * with DirectX 12 / Vulkan 1.1
     * with DirectX Ray Tracing API
     * DirectX 11 Fallback Layer for Windows 7 support (not extensively tested)
  * Linux Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Vulkan 1.1
- Android Pie with Vulkan 1.1
- macOS with Metal 2
- iOS with Metal 2
- XBOX One / XBOX One X (only available for accredited developers on request)
- PS4 (in development) (only available for accredited developers on request)

Particularly, the graphics layer of The Forge supports cross-platform
- Descriptor management
- Multi-threaded and asynchronous resource loading
- Shader reflection
- Multi-threaded command buffer generation

The Forge can be used to provide the rendering layer for custom next-gen game engines. It is also meant to provide building blocks to write your own game engine. It is like a "lego" set that allows you to use pieces to build a game engine quickly. The "lego" High-Level Features supported on all platforms are at the moment:
- Asynchronous Resource loading with a resource loader task system as shown in 10_PixelProjectedReflections
- [Lua Scripting System](https://www.lua.org/) - currently used in 06_Playground to load models and textures and animate the camera
- Animation System based on [Ozz Animation System](https://github.com/guillaumeblanc/ozz-animation)
- Consistent Math Library  based on an extended version of [Vectormath](https://github.com/glampert/vectormath)
- Extended version of [TinySTL](https://github.com/mendsley/tinystl)
- For loading art assets we have a modified and integrated version of [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)
- Consistent Memory Managament: on GPU following [Vulkan Memory Allocator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)
- Input system with Gestures for Touch devices based on an extended version of [gainput](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/gainput)
- Very fast Entity Component System based on [ENTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt)
- UI system based on [imGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) with a dedicated unit test extended for touch input devices
- Various implementations of high-end Graphics Effects as shown in the unit tests below

Please find a link and credits for all open-source packages used at the end of this readme.


Future plans are
- Unified shader generation -> check out an alpha version of the [Confetti Shader Translator](http://confettishadertranslator.azurewebsites.net). This shader translator is build with the purpose of supporting a higher-level shading language, which we call super HLSL or short sHLSL

# News

## Release 1.26 - April 3rd, 2019 - Vulkan Ray Tracing for Windows & Linux
- Ray Tracing with the Vulkan API (Vulkan SDK 1.1.101.0) is now working on Windows and Ubuntu through our unified Ray Tracing interface in IRay.h:

PC Ubuntu Vulkan RTX, GeForce RTX 2070, Driver Version 418.56 1080p
![Ray Tracing on PC Ubuntu with Vulkan RTX](Screenshots/16_RayTrace_Linux_Vulkan.png)

PC Windows 10 RS5, DirectX12, GeForce RTX 2070, Driver version 418.81 1080p:
![Ray Tracing on PC With DXR](Screenshots/16_RayTrace_Windows_DXR.png)

Mac Mini with Intel Core i5 3GHz cpu with integrated graphics Intel UHD Graphics 630 (Part No. MRTT2RU/A) with resolution 3440x1440:
![Ray Tracing on macOS](Screenshots/RayTracing_macOS.png)

iPad 6th Generation iOS 12.1.3 (16D39) with a resolution of 2048x1536
![Ray Tracing on iOS](Screenshots/RayTracing_iPad.png)

- New Descriptor Memory Management System: we did a second pass over that system and improved performance and memory consumption further. Now we can group individual descriptor bindors into a single one. A lot of bug and memory leak fixes were done as well.
- Async / Sync Resource Loading system: instead of allocating additional memory, it uses now fixed size memory and splits resources for upload
- Unified UniformRingBuffer and MeshRingBuffer into GPURingBuffer
- Vulkan: we implemented now something close to the official recommendation how to convert "Vsync on/off" to Vulkan parameters (in pseudocode) (thanks to Adam Sawicki
@Reg__):
```cpp
if mEnableVsync:
    Try to find among available present modes, in this order: FIFO_RELAXED, FIFO
else:
    Try to find among available present modes, in this order: IMMEDIATE, MAILBOX, FIFO (we prefer here FIFO_RELAXED instead)

if chosen mode == IMMEDIATE:
    imageCount = (Fullscreen ? 2 : 3)
else if chosen mode == MAILBOX:
    imageCount = 3
else if chosen mode == FIFO or FIFO_RELAXED:
    imageCount = 2
imageCount = max(VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR::minImageCount, min(imageCount, VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR::maxImageCount))
```

## Release 1.25 - March 15th, 2019 - New Descriptor Memory Management System | Refactored Input System

- The purpose of the DescriptorBinder approach is to allocate all memory descriptor space at load time (streaming is also considered load time), instead of doing it on-demand at runtime, as it is commonly done. This is done in an effort to allow applications to have better control over memory footprint overhead, which is especially important on mobile targets, and to improve performance by avoiding runtime memory allocations.
The system will use shader reflection to determine the appropriate descriptor layouts in combination with descriptor update frequency knowledge. This knowledge will come from the client domain or from content editor tools.
With this information, we are able to allocate all necessary descriptor memory up-front, giving more control to the application about the memory footprint. This is one of the initiatives leading up to the new version of The Forge.
Read more [Descriptor Management](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge/wiki/Descriptor-Management)

- The input system was refactored and streamlined. This is mostly a rewrite of the code layer above [gainput](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/gainput).
  - IOperatingSystem.h: getMousePosition, getKeyDown, getKeyUp, getJoystickButtonDown, getJoystickButtonUp were removed
  - InputSystem.h: 
    - KeyMappingDescription - changed now every axis should be defined as separate entry
    - IsButtonPressed, IsButtonTriggered, IsButtonReleased, MapKey, SetActiveInputMap,  GetButtonData,  GetDisplayWidth, GetDisplayHeight, were removed
    - New functions GetBoolInput, GetFloatInput. KeyMappingDescription  for new function require directly specifying intended action(released, pressed, triggered) via DEFINE_DEVICE_ACTION macro
    - For InputEventHandler old style definition is used

## Release 1.24 - March 1st, 2019 - Asynchronous Resource Loading | Micro Profiler
- The Forge now allows to asynchronously load resources on all platforms. There are two ways to do this:
  - use addResource/updateResource with boolean parameter called batch set to true, and later wait for completion with waitBatchCompleted (used in 01_Transformations, 03_MultiThread, 06_MaterialPlayground, 09_LightShadowPlayground, 09a_HybridRaytracing, 12_RendererRumtimeSwitch, 15_Transparency)
  - use addResource with SyncToken parameter and check for completion with isTokenCompleted or wait for completion with waitTokenCompleted (used in 10_PixelProjectedReflections)
addResource/updateResource with boolean parameter set to false are the old blocking versions.
Let us know what you think of this system.
- We integrated zeux's [Micro Profiler](https://github.com/zeux/microprofile) into The Forge. So far it supports DirectX 11, 12 and Vulkan. We are still working on Metal and Android support.

- Better integration of Ray Tracing into the renderer; still Vulkan RTX is work in progress
- Fixed Vulkan instance extension bug: "InstanceLayers loop is wrong in CreateInstance" issue #92



See the release notes from previous releases in the [Release section](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge/releases).

  
# PC Windows Requirements:

1. Windows 10 RS5 with latest update for DXR support


2. Drivers
* AMD / NVIDIA - latest drivers 
* Intel - need to install the latest driver (currently Version: 25.20.100.6326, October 9th, 2018) [Intel® Graphics Driver for Windows® 10](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/28240/Intel-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-10?product=80939). As mentioned before this driver still doesn't have full DirectX 12 and Vulkan support.


3. Visual Studio 2017 with Windows SDK / DirectX version 17763.132 
https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive

4. Vulkan [1.1.101.0](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)

6. The Forge is currently tested on 
* AMD 5x, VEGA GPUs (various)
* NVIDIA GeForce 9x, 10x. 20x GPUs (various)
* Intel Skull Canyon


# macOS Requirements:

1. macOS Mojave 10.14.4 beta (18E174f)

2. Xcode 10.2 beta (10P82s)

3. The Forge is currently tested on the following macOS devices:
* iMac with AMD RADEON 560 (Part No. MNDY2xx/A)
* iMac with AMD RADEON 580 (Part No. MNED2xx/A)
* MacBook Pro 13 inch (MacBookPro13,2) 
* Macbook Pro 13 inch (MacbookPro14,2)

In the moment we do not have access to an iMac Pro or Mac Pro. We can test those either with Team Viewer access or by getting them into the office and integrating them into our build system.
We will not test any Hackintosh configuration. 


# iOS Requirements:

1. iOS 12.2 beta (16E5181f)

2. XCode: see macOS

To run the unit tests, The Forge requires an iOS device with an A9 or higher CPU (see [GPU Processors](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeviceInformation/Reference/iOSDeviceCompatibility/HardwareGPUInformation/HardwareGPUInformation.html) or see iOS_Family in this table [iOS_GPUFamily3_v3](https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Feature-Set-Tables.pdf)). This is required to support the hardware tessellation unit test and the ExecuteIndirect unit test (requires indirect buffer support). The Visibility Buffer doesn't run on current iOS devices because the [texture argument buffer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/fundamental_components/gpu_resources/understanding_argument_buffers) on those devices is limited to 31 (see [Metal Feature Set Table](https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Feature-Set-Tables.pdf) and look for the entry "Maximum number of entries in the texture argument table, per graphics or compute function") , while on macOS it is 128, which we need for the bindless texture array. 

We are currently testing on 
* iPhone 7 (Model A1778)
* iPad (Model A1893)
* iPhone Xs Max (Model MT5D2LL/A)

![Image of the Transformations Unit test](Screenshots/01_Transformations.PNG)

## 2. Compute

This unit test shows a Julia 4D fractal running in a compute shader. In the future this test will use several compute queues at once.

![Image of the Compute Shader Unit test](Screenshots/02_Compute.PNG)

## 3. Multi-Threaded Rendering

This unit test shows how to generate a large number of command buffers on all platforms supported by The Forge. This unit test is based on [a demo by Intel called Stardust](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-vulkan-graphics-api-to-render-a-cloud-of-animated-particles-in-stardust-application).

![Image of the Multi-Threaded command buffer generation example](Screenshots/03_MultiThreading.PNG)

![Light & Shadow Playground](Screenshots/09_LightShadowPlayground_Linux.png)

## 9a. Hybrid Ray-Traced Shadows
This unit test was build by Kostas Anagnostou @KostasAAA to show how to ray trace shadows without using a ray tracing API like DXR / RTX. It should run on all GPUs (not just NVIDIA RTX GPUs) and the expectation is that it should run comparable with a DXR / RTX based version even on a NVIDIA RTX GPU. That means the users of your game do not have to buy a NVIDIA RTX GPU to enjoy HRT shadows :-)
