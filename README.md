The-Forge-Lite is a stripped-down version of The-Forge which just supplies the renderer interface, uses CMake to build and contains the bare minimum of third-party libraries.

The public interfaces also try to reduce the amount of headers needed, but TinySTL is still needed.

The idea is also to keep these changes to a minimum so that it is easy and straightforward to update from ConfettiFX's [GitHub](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge).

If you are new to The-Forge, I highly recommend using the official one and not this one, it is fairly specific to my needs. However it might be useful to you if you just wanted the excellent graphics API abstraction and straightforward build process.

From the official The-Forge readme:

# ![The Forge Logo](Screenshots/TheForge-on-white.jpg)

The Forge is a cross-platform rendering framework supporting
- PC 
  * Windows 10 
     * with DirectX 12 / Vulkan 1.1
     * with DirectX Ray Tracing API
     * DirectX 11 Fallback Layer for Windows 7 support (not extensively tested)
  * Linux Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Vulkan 1.1 and RTX Ray Tracing API
- Android Pie with Vulkan 1.1
- macOS / iOS / iPad OS with Metal 2
- XBOX One / XBOX One X (only available for accredited developers on request)
- PS4 (only available for accredited developers on request)
- Switch (in development) (only available for accredited developers on request)
- Google Stadia (in development) (only available for accredited developers on request)

Particularly, the graphics layer of The Forge supports cross-platform
- Descriptor management
- Multi-threaded and asynchronous resource loading
- Shader reflection
- Multi-threaded command buffer generation

The Forge can be used to provide the rendering layer for custom next-gen game engines. It is also meant to provide building blocks to write your own game engine. It is like a "lego" set that allows you to use pieces to build a game engine quickly. The "lego" High-Level Features supported on all platforms are at the moment:
- Asynchronous Resource loading with a resource loader task system as shown in 10_PixelProjectedReflections
- [Lua Scripting System](https://www.lua.org/) - currently used in 06_Playground to load models and textures and animate the camera
- Animation System based on [Ozz Animation System](https://github.com/guillaumeblanc/ozz-animation)
- Consistent Math Library  based on an extended version of [Vectormath](https://github.com/glampert/vectormath) with NEON intrinsics for mobile platforms
- Extended version of [EASTL](https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL/)
- For loading art assets we have a modified and integrated version of [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)
- Consistent Memory Managament: 
  * on GPU following [Vulkan Memory Allocator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)
  * on CPU [Fluid Studios Memory Manager](http://www.paulnettle.com/)
- Input system with Gestures for Touch devices based on an extended version of [gainput](https://github.com/jkuhlmann/gainput)
- Fast Entity Component System based on our internally developed ECS
- UI system based on [imGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) with a dedicated unit test extended for touch input devices
- Audio based on integrating [SoLoud](https://github.com/jarikomppa/soloud)
- Various implementations of high-end Graphics Effects as shown in the unit tests below

# News

## Release 1.30 - June 28th, 2019 - Ephemeris 2 - New Skydome System | Android Unit Tests | New Entity Component System | SoLoud Audio 
 * Ephemeris 2: this is a new volumetric skydome system developed for PS4 / XBOX One class of hardware. Click on the image to watch a video:

 [![Ephemeris 2](Screenshots/Ephemeris2.png)](https://vimeo.com/344675521)

 For Ephemeris and the rest of our commercial custom middleware there is now a new GitHub repository here [Custom-Middleware](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/Custom-Middleware) 

 We also have a skydome system for mobile hardware called Ephemeris 1, that will be released on GitHub later.

 * Android: we are supporting now more and more unit tests in Android by improving the run-time support. Here are screenshots:

17_EntityComponentSystem
![17_EntityComponentSystem](Screenshots/Screenshot_20190620-060737_EntityComponentSystem.jpg)

 We added the Samsung S10 Galaxy phone (Qualcomm Adreno 640 Graphics Card (Vulkan 1.1.87)) to the test devices for Android. 

 * ENTT: we decided to remove ENTT and replace it with our own ECS system that we use internally for tools. ENTT in debug is too slow for practical usage because it decreases execution speed and increases compile times substantially. It appears that "modern C++ 17" and probably also "modern C++ 14" is not ready for usage in a team environment because it decreases productivity too much. We tried to remove C++ 17 and 14 features to make it run faster but it ended up too much work. We went from more than 200 ms with ENTT to 60 ms with our own ECS running a Debug build on a Intel Core i7-6700T 2.8GHz. In release our own system is in the moment not as fast as ENTT but we will fix that.

 * Audio: we did a first pass on integrating [SoLoud](https://github.com/jarikomppa/soloud) for all our platforms. There is a new unit test:

![26_Audio](Screenshots/26_Audio.png)
 
 * Linux: following STEAM, we are switching to the Mesa RADV driver in our test environment for AMD GPUs. For NVIDIA GPUs we are still using the NVIDIA driver.

 * Texture Asset pipeline: we did a first pass on a unified texture asset pipeline. On the app level only the name of the texture needs to be provided and then depending on the underlying platform it will attempt to load the "optimal compressed" texture, which in the moment is either KTX or dds. In the future there will be Google Basis support as well.
   * Removed support for various non-optimal texture file formats - png, jpg, tga, hdr, exr
   * Add ASTC support for iOS through KTX container
   * Add compressed textures for all unit test resources
   * Add BC6H signed and unsigned float variants
   
  Please make sure you download the art asset zip file again with the help of the batch file.

* Issue list:
   * issue #109 "Texture updates broken" is fixed now
   * NVIDIA GTX 1660 bug: this card with the Vulkan run-time and driver 419.35 became unresponsive, while the DirectX 12 run-time works as expected. Any other NVIDIA GPU works fine ... this looks like a driver bug ...

## Release 1.29 - June 6th, 2019 - EASTL Integration | Micro-profiler improvements | Neon intrinsic Support
 * We replaced for all platforms TinySTL with [EASTL](https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL/) for support of additional data structures and functionality. This was a major change and we still expect a few bugs to appear.
 * ARM based platforms (iOS/Android) can pick a new NEON intrinsics code path in our math library
 * Microprofiler  
   * Multithreaded GPU Profiling is now supported
   * Microprofiler is now enabled on all the Unit-tests and togglable using UI checkbox.
   * Added new common interface, IProfiler.h
 * Issue fixed: 
   * #105 - 04_ExecuteIndirect crash on macOS


## Release 1.28 - May 24th, 2019 - SWB Level Editor | Micro Profiler Re-Write | Log and File System improvements | better macOS/iOS support 
We added a new section below the Examples to show screenshots and an explanation of some of the Tools that we integrated. We will fill this up over the next few releases.
* We were helping James Webb with his level editor for 'Star Wars Galaxies' called SWB that now uses The Forge

Here is a screenshot

![SWB Level Editor](Screenshots/SWB.png)

SWB is an editor for the 2003 game 'Star Wars Galaxies' that can edit terrains, scenes, particles and import/export models via FBX. The editor uses an engine called 'atlas' that will be made open source in the future. It focuses on making efficient use of the new graphics APIs (with help from The-Forge!), ease-of-use and terrain rendering.
* Memory tracking: 
  * Fluid memory tracker cross-platform for Windows, macOS and Linux
  * We used MTuner to remove many memory leaks and improve memory usage. MTuner might be integrated in the future.
* [Micro Profiler](https://github.com/zeux/microprofile): our initial implementation of Microprofiler needed to be re-done from scratch. This time we wanted to do the integration right and also implemented the dedicated UI. 

![Microprofiler in Visibility Buffer](Screenshots/MicroProfileExampleVisibilityBuffer.png)

![Microprofiler in Visibility Buffer](Screenshots/MicroProfileExampleVisibilityBuffer2.png)

To enable/disable profiling, go to file ProfileEnableMacro.h line 9 and set it
to 0(disabled) or 1(enabled). 
It's supported on the following platforms:
 - Windows
 - Linux
 - macOS (GPU profiling is disabled)
 - iOS (GPU profiling is disabled)
 - Android(WIP will be enabled later on)

We can find MicroProfile integrated in the follwing examples (more will follow):
 - Unit Test 02_Compute
 - VisibilityBuffer

How to use it:
MicroProfile has different display modes. The most useful one when running inside
the application is Timers. We can change the display mode going to Mode and right
clicking the one we want.

If we are on Timer, we will be able to right click on the labels. This will enable
a graph at the bottom left.

If we wanted to just see some of the groups inside the profile display, go to Groups
and select the ones you want.

The other options are self explanatory.

If the user wants to dump the profile to a file, we just need to go to dump,
and right click on the amount of frames we want. This generates a html file in the
executable folder. Open it with your prefered web browser to have a look.

Dumping is useful, because we will be able to see the profile frame by frame,
without it being updated every frame. This will be useful when displaying in Detailed
mode.

There is also a Help menu item.
* Log system improvements: 
  * Support for multiple log files
  * Easy to use log macros
  * Scoped logging
  * Multithreaded support
  * New log format: date, time, thread, file, line, log level and message
  * No need to declare global LogManager, it will be created on demand
* Filesystem improvements: this is fed  back from one of our game engine integrations of The Forge
  * file time functions now use time_t
  * added FileWatcher class for Windows/Linux/macOS
  * added CombinePaths function
* macOS / iOS Metal: 
  * added Barriers with memoryBarrierWithScope for Buffers,Textures and Render targets
  * added GPU sync with MTLFence as fallback (for cross encoder synchranization and BlitEncoder where memoryBarrier isn't available). Removed force fence on render targets change because it is no longer necessary. There might be a small performance improvements coming from this
  * support of Microprofiler see above
  * refactor of windows support code: replaced MTKView for iOS and macOS with a custom NSview and NSWindow implementation. We have more explicit control now over the window.
* Issues fixed:
  * #112 - cmdBindDescriptors performance issue (DX12)
  * #110 - RenderDoc compatibility with SM6+

See the release notes from previous releases in the [Release section](https://github.com/ConfettiFX/The-Forge/releases).

# Unit Tests
There are the following unit tests in The Forge:

## 1. Transformation

This unit test just shows a simple solar system. It is our "3D game Hello World" setup for cross-platform rendering.

![Image of the Transformations Unit test](Screenshots/01_Transformations.PNG)

## 2. Compute

This unit test shows a Julia 4D fractal running in a compute shader. In the future this test will use several compute queues at once.

![Image of the Compute Shader Unit test](Screenshots/02_Compute.PNG)

## 3. Multi-Threaded Rendering

This unit test shows how to generate a large number of command buffers on all platforms supported by The Forge. This unit test is based on [a demo by Intel called Stardust](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-vulkan-graphics-api-to-render-a-cloud-of-animated-particles-in-stardust-application).

![Image of the Multi-Threaded command buffer generation example](Screenshots/03_MultiThreading.PNG)

## 4. ExecuteIndirect

This unit test shows the difference in speed between Instanced Rendering, using ExecuteIndirect with CPU update of the indirect argument buffers and using ExecuteIndirect with GPU update of the indirect argument buffers.
This unit test is based on [the Asteroids example by Intel](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/asteroids-and-directx-12-performance-and-power-savings).

## 5. Font Rendering

This unit test shows the current state of our font rendering library that is based on several open-source libraries.

![Image of the Font Rendering Unit test](Screenshots/05_FontRendering.PNG)

## 6. Material Playground

This unit test shows a range of game related materials:

Hair:
Many years ago in 2012 / 2013, we helped AMD and Crystal Dynamics with the development of TressFX for Tomb Raider. We also wrote an article about the implementation in GPU Pro 5 and gave a few joint presentations on conferences like FMX. At the end of last year we revisited TressFX. We took the current code in the GitHub repository, changed it a bit and ported it to The Forge. It now runs on PC with DirectX 12 / Vulkan, macOS and iOS with Metal 2 and on the XBOX One. We also created a few new hair assets so that we can showcase it. Here is a screenshot of our programmer art:

![Hair on PC](Screenshots/MaterialPlayground/06_MaterialPlayground_Hair_closup.gif)

Metal:

![Material Playground Metal on PC](Screenshots/MaterialPlayground/06_MaterialPlayground_Metal.png)

Wood:

![Light & Shadow Playground](Screenshots/09_LightShadowPlayground_Linux.png)

## 9a. Hybrid Ray-Traced Shadows
This unit test was build by Kostas Anagnostou @KostasAAA to show how to ray trace shadows without using a ray tracing API like DXR / RTX. It should run on all GPUs (not just NVIDIA RTX GPUs) and the expectation is that it should run comparable with a DXR / RTX based version even on a NVIDIA RTX GPU. That means the users of your game do not have to buy a NVIDIA RTX GPU to enjoy HRT shadows :-)
![Hybrid Ray Traced Shadows](Screenshots/09a_HRT_Shadows.png)


## 10. Pixel-Projected Reflections
This unit test shows reflections that are ray traced. It is an implementation of the papers [Optimized pixel-projected reflections for planar reflectors](http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2017/PixelProjectedReflectionsAC_v_1.92.pdf) and [IMPLEMENTATION OF OPTIMIZED PIXEL-PROJECTED REFLECTIONS FOR PLANAR REFLECTORS](https://github.com/byumjin/Jin-Engine-2.1/blob/master/%5BByumjin%20Kim%5D%20Master%20Thesis_Final.pdf)

## 26. Audio Integration of SoLoud
We integrated SoLoad. Here is a unit test that allow's you make noise ...

![26_Audio](Screenshots/26_Audio.png)



# Examples
There is an example implementation of the Triangle Visibility Buffer as covered in various conference talks. [Here](https://diaryofagraphicsprogrammer.blogspot.com/2018/03/triangle-visibility-buffer.html) is a blog entry that details the implementation in The Forge.

![Image of the Visibility Buffer](Screenshots/Visibility_Buffer.png)


# Tools
Below are screenshots and descriptions of some of the tools we integrated.

## Microprofiler
We integrated the [Micro Profiler](https://github.com/zeux/microprofile) into our code base. 

![Microprofiler in Visibility Buffer](Screenshots/MicroProfileExampleVisibilityBuffer.png)

![Microprofiler in Visibility Buffer](Screenshots/MicroProfileExampleVisibilityBuffer2.png)

To enable/disable profiling, go to file ProfileEnableMacro.h line 9 and set it
to 0(disabled) or 1(enabled). 
It's supported on the following platforms:
 - Windows
 - Linux
 - macOS (GPU profiling is disabled)
 - iOS (GPU profiling is disabled)
 - Android 

MicroProfile provides us an easy to use UI and visualization our frame.

How to use it:
MicroProfile has different display modes. The most useful one when running inside
the application is Timers. We can change the display mode going to Mode and right
clicking the one we want.

If we are on Timer, we will be able to right click on the labels. This will enable
a graph at the bottom left.

If we wanted to just see some of the groups inside the profile display, go to Groups
and select the ones you want.

The other options are self explanatory.

If the user wants to dump the profile to a file, we just need to go to dump,
and right click on the amount of frames we want. This generates a html file in the
executable folder. Open it with your prefered web browser to have a look.

Dumping is useful, because we will be able to see the profile frame by frame,
without it being updated every frame. This will be useful when displaying in Detailed

# Releases / Maintenance
Confetti will prepare releases when all the platforms are stable and running and push them to this GitHub repository. Up until a release, development will happen on internal servers. This is to sync up the console, mobile, macOS and PC versions of the source code.

# Products

## Star Wars Galaxies Level Editor
SWB is an editor for the 2003 game 'Star Wars Galaxies' that can edit terrains, scenes, particles and import/export models via FBX. The editor uses an engine called 'atlas' that will be made open source in the future. It focuses on making efficient use of the new graphics APIs (with help from The-Forge!), ease-of-use and terrain rendering.
