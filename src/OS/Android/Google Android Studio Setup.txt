https://developer.android.com/studio/

Dowload the apropriate platforms in <SDK Platforms> and then download from <SDK Tools> 
- Android Build Tools and lots of other tools
- Google USB driver

- When you have the NDK downloaded, compile shaderc by navigating to <ndk-root>/sources/third_party/shaderc/, then running the following command.
..\..\..\ndk-build.cmd NDK_PROJECT_PATH=. APP_BUILD_SCRIPT=Android.mk APP_STL:=gnustl_static APP_ABI=all libshaderc_combined

- Open a terminal window, and use git to clone the Android Vulkan samples from the repository in which they reside.
$ git clone https://github.com/googlesamples/vulkan-basic-samples.git

- Navigate to this LunarGSamples/ directory, which is in the local repository that you checked out in the previous step.
Update the gslang source by running the following command.
